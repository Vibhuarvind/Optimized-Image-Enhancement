# Optimized-Image-Enhancement

The primary goal of this project was not just to enhance quality of the image, but to do it in the shortest amount of time possible by using the concept of parallelism because it can be a costly affair to simply improve the contrast of images. For this, several types of histogram - based approaches, as well as bilateral denoising, were implemented on varying number of cores to see how algorithm has improved its speed. For both the libraries Joblib and Multiprocessing, the outcomes of algorithms implemented in serial and parallel modes have been compared.
